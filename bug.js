This React component uses the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array `[]`. This means the effect will only run once after the component mounts. However, it attempts to update state using `setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);`.  Since this state update happens outside of a response to a prop or state change, React may not re-render the component to reflect this change, resulting in the counter seemingly not incrementing.
